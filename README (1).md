## Overview

**DDLSim-BY-KTRUBY** is an **open-source conceptual project** that presents a **clear, non-technical overview** of how teams might plan and communicate a simulation of distributed AI training environments—**without** implementation details or runnable code.

The goal is to help teams **align on the big picture**, discuss potential risks and priorities, and share a **professional, visual summary** before committing resources.

> This repository focuses on **ideas, visuals, and narrative only**.  
> It **does not** include executable code, scripts, or setup instructions.

---

## Vision

- **Simplify complexity** — turn large-scale training concepts into elegant visuals and plain language.  
- **Enable planning** — provide a friendly artifact for discussions with research leads, committees, and partners.  
- **Look professional** — use polished badges, placeholders, and a consistent visual identity out of the box.

---

## What This Project Is (and Isn’t)

**This project is:**
- A **concept deck** inside a README—visual, lightweight, easy to share.  
- A **communication aid** to describe intent, value, and audience.  
- A **starting point** for collecting feedback and aligning expectations.

**This project is not:**
- A technical manual, benchmark, or performance guide.  
- A collection of scripts, commands, or runnable examples.  
- An implementation reference for infrastructure or models.

---

## Why It Matters

- Creates a **shared language** between researchers, leadership, and stakeholders.  
- Supports **early decision-making** by clarifying goals and scope—without tech noise.  
- Delivers a **polished presence** for outreach, collaboration, and fundraising.

---

## Audience

- Research groups needing a **non-technical brief** to socialize an idea.  
- Academic programs explaining **distributed training concepts** at a high level.  
- Organizations seeking a **clean, visual summary** before committing resources.

## Social Preview (Optional)

Add a social preview image to help your README look great when shared:

- Temporary preview:  
  `https://placehold.co/1200x630/111111/FFFFFF?text=DDLSim%20Concept%20Preview`

Later, upload a real preview via **Settings → Social preview**.

---

## Roadmap (Conceptual)

- Expand visual library (icons, diagrams, storyboards).  
- Add use-case narratives for education and outreach.  
- Provide a lightweight, static overview site (optional).  
- Collect collaborator feedback and refine content.  
- Prepare a one-page PDF brief for executive audiences.

> The roadmap stays **non-technical**; no code deliverables are planned here.

---

## Contribution Guidelines (Content-Only)

We welcome **content contributions** (no code):

1. Open an **Issue** describing your idea (e.g., “diagram: risk map”).  
2. Add assets (SVG/PNG/Markdown) in `docs/assets/` or `docs/sections/`.  
3. Submit a **Pull Request** referencing the Issue.

**Style tips**
- Prefer short paragraphs and meaningful headings.  
- Use neutral colors, high contrast, and accessible alt text for images.  
- Keep diagrams conceptual—avoid low-level details.
